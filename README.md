               For it to function, you must have a camera inorder for it to work. 
               If camera isnt working change the cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) to cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)
               
               Some things can be accurately recognized, 
               therefore if the camera isn't operating, alter cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) to cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1). 
               
               Then, just click the terminal and run in cmd:python (filename).py
